      "Industrial emissions",
      "Industrial emissions are a significant source of air pollution, 
      releasing harmful substances into the atmosphere during manufacturing 
      and energy production processes. Factories and power plants often emit 
      pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen 
      oxides (NOₓ), and particulate matter, which can degrade air quality and 
      harm human health. These emissions result from the burning of fossil 
      fuels, chemical processing, and waste incineration. The release of 
      volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals further exacerbates 
      environmental issues, contributing to smog, acid rain, and climate change. 
      Reducing industrial emissions through cleaner technologies and stricter 
      regulations is vital for mitigating air pollution and its effects.",
